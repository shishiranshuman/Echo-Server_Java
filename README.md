# Echo-Server_Java


Echo server is an application which is used to test if the connection is created between the clients and the server.The server echoes the message received from multiple clients. Multithreading in Java was used for the implementation.

The repository contains two files:  
1: multithreadSocket.java - SERVER CODE  
2: multithreadSocket_client - CLIENT CODE  

Compile and run the server code and the client code on seperate terminals. For multiple clients, run the client code on multiple terminals.
